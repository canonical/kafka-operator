# Charmed Kafka Operator

## Overview

The Charmed Kafka Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) event streaming platform. It is an open source, end-to-end, production ready data platform on top of cloud native technologies.

This operator charm comes with features such as:
- Fault-tolerance, replication, scalability and high-availability out-of-the-box.
- SASL/SCRAM auth for Broker-Broker and Client-Broker authenticaion enabled by default.
- Access control management supported with user-provided ACL lists.

The Kafka Operator uses the latest upstream Kafka binaries released by the The Apache Software Foundation that comes with Kafka, made available using the [`charmed-kafka` snap ](https://snapcraft.io/charmed-kafka) distributed by Canonical.

As currently Kafka requires a paired ZooKeeper deployment in production, this operator makes use of the [ZooKeeper Operator](https://github.com/canonical/zookeeper-operator) for various essential functions.

## Requirements

For production environments, it is recommended to deploy at least 5 nodes for Zookeeper and 3 for Kafka.
While the following requirements are meant to be for production, the charm can be deployed in much smaller environments.

- 64GB of RAM
- 24 cores
- 12 storage devices
- 10 GbE card

## Usage

### Basic usage

The Kafka and ZooKeeper operators can both be deployed as follows:
```shell
$ juju deploy zookeeper --channel latest/edge -n 5
$ juju deploy kafka --channel latest/edge -n 3
```

After this, it is necessary to connect them:
```shell
$ juju relate kafka zookeeper
```

To watch the process, `juju status` can be used. Once all the units show as `active|idle` the credentials to access a broker can be queried with:
```shell
juju run-action kafka/leader get-admin-credentials --wait 
```

Apache Kafka ships with `bin/*.sh` commands to do various administrative tasks, e.g `bin/kafka-config.sh` to update cluster configuration, `bin/kafka-topics.sh` for topic management, and many more! The Kafka Charmed Operator provides these commands to administrators to easily run their desired cluster configurations securely with SASL authentication, either from within the cluster or as an external client.

If you wish to run a command from the cluster, in order to (for example) list the current topics on the Kafka cluster, you can run:
```
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=$(juju run-action kafka/leader get-admin-credentials --wait | grep "bootstrap.servers" | cut -d "=" -f 2)
juju ssh kafka/leader 'kafka.topics --bootstrap-server $BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS --list --command-config /var/snap/kafka/common/client.properties'
```

Available Kafka bin commands can be found with:
```
snap info charmed-kafka --channel latest/edge
```

### Replication
#### Scaling up
The charm can be scaled up using `juju add-unit` command.
```shell
juju add-unit kafka
```

To add a specific number of brokers, an extra argument is needed:
```shell
juju add-unit kafka -n <num_brokers_to_add>
```

#### Scaling down
To scale down the charm, use `juju remove-unit` command.
```shell
juju remove-unit <unit_name>
```

Even when scaling multiple units at the same time, the charm uses a rolling restart sequence to make sure the cluster stays available and healthy during the operation.

### Password rotation
#### Internal operator user
The operator user is used internally by the Charmed Kafka Operator, the `set-password` action can be used to rotate its password.
```shell
# to set a specific password for the operator user
juju run-action kafka/leader set-password password=<password> --wait

# to randomly generate a password for the operator user
juju run-action kafka/leader set-password --wait
```

### Storage support

Currently, the Charmed Kafka Operator supports 1 or more storage volumes. A 10G storage volume will be installed by default for `log.dirs`
This is used for logs storage, mounted on `/var/snap/kafka/common`

When storage is added or removed, the Kafka service will restart to ensure it uses the new volumes. Additionally, log + charm status messages will prompt users to manually reassign partitions so that the new storage volumes are populated. By default, Kafka will not assign partitions to new directories/units until existing topic partitions are assigned to it, or a new topic is created

## Relations

Supported [relations](https://juju.is/docs/olm/relations):

#### `kafka_client` interface:

The `kafka_client` interface is used with the `data-integrator` charm. This charm allows to automatically create and manage product credentials needed to authenticate with different kinds of data platform charmed products:

Deploy the data-integrator charm with the desired `topic-name` and user roles: 
```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --channel edge
juju config data-integrator topic-name=test-topic extra-user-roles=producer,consumer
```

Relate the two applications with:
```shell
juju relate data-integrator kafka
```

To retrieve information, enter:
```shell
juju run-action data-integrator/leader get-credentials --wait
```

This should output something like:
```yaml
unit-data-integrator-0:                                                         
  UnitId: data-integrator/0

  results:                                                                      
    kafka:

```

#### `tls-certificates` interface:

The `tls-certificates` interface is used with the `tls-certificates-operator` charm.

To enable TLS:

```shell
# deploy the TLS charm 
juju deploy tls-certificates-operator --channel=edge
# add the necessary configurations for TLS
juju config tls-certificates-operator generate-self-signed-certificates="true" ca-common-name="Test CA" 
# to enable TLS relate the two applications 
juju relate tls-certificates-operator zookeeper
juju relate tls-certificates-operator kafka
```

Updates to private keys for certificate signing requests (CSR) can be made via the `set-tls-private-key` action.
```shell
# Updates can be done with auto-generated keys with
juju run-action kafka/0 set-tls-private-key --wait
juju run-action kafka/1 set-tls-private-key --wait
juju run-action kafka/2 set-tls-private-key --wait
```

Passing keys to external/internal keys should *only be done with* `base64 -w0` *not* `cat`. With three brokers this schema should be followed:
```shell
# generate shared internal key
openssl genrsa -out internal-key.pem 3072
# apply keys on each unit
juju run-action kafka/0 set-tls-private-key "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"  --wait
juju run-action kafka/1 set-tls-private-key "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"  --wait
juju run-action kafka/2 set-tls-private-key "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"  --wait
```

To disable TLS remove the relation
```shell
juju remove-relation kafka tls-certificates-operator
juju remove-relation zookeeper tls-certificates-operator
```

Note: The TLS settings here are for self-signed-certificates which are not recommended for production clusters, the `tls-certificates-operator` charm offers a variety of configurations, read more on the TLS charm [here](https://charmhub.io/tls-certificates-operator)


## Monitoring

The Charmed Kafka Operator comes with several exporters by default. The metrics can be queried by accessing the following endpoints:

- Node exporter: `http://<unit-ip>:9100/metrics`
- JMX exporter: `http://<unit-ip>:9101/metrics`

Additionally, the charm provides integration with the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack).

Deploy cos-lite bundle in a Kubernetes environment. This can be done by following the [deployment tutorial](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s). Since the Charmed Kafka Operator is deployed on a machine environment, it is needed to offer the endpoints of the COS relations. The [offers-overlay](https://github.com/canonical/cos-lite-bundle/blob/main/overlays/offers-overlay.yaml) can be used, and this step is shown on the COS tutorial.

Once COS is deployed, we can find the offers from the Kafka model:
```shell
# We are on the Kubernetes controller, for the cos model. Switch to kafka model
juju switch <machine_controller_name>:<kafka_model_name>

juju find-offers <k8s_controller_name>:
```

A similar output should appear, if `micro` is the k8s controller name and `cos` the model where `cos-lite` has been deployed:
```
Store  URL                   Access  Interfaces                         
micro  admin/cos.grafana     admin   grafana_dashboard:grafana-dashboard
micro  admin/cos.prometheus  admin   prometheus_scrape:metrics-endpoint
. . .
```

Now, relate kafka with the `metrics-endpoint` and `grafana-dashboard` interfaces:
```shell
juju relate micro:admin/cos.prometheus kafka
juju relate micro:admin/cos.grafana kafka
```

After this is complete, Grafana will show two new dashboards: `Kafka Metrics` and `Node Exporter Kafka`
