## Charmed Kafka Documentation

Charmed Kafka is an open-source operator that makes it easier to operate Apache Kafka with built-in support for enterprise features. 

Charmed Kafka is build on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/) and it simplifies the deployment, scaling, design and management of Apache Kafka in production in a reliable way. In addition, you can use the operator to manage your Kafka clusters with automation capabilities. It also offers replication, TLS, password rotation, easy-to-use application integration, and monitoring.
Charmed Kafka operates Apache Kafka on physical, Virtual Machines (VM) and other wide range of cloud and cloud-like environments, including AWS, Azure, OpenStack and VMWare. 

Charmed Kafka is a solution designed and developed for helping organizations and 
DB administrators automating Apache Kafka operations management from day 0 to day 2, across multiple cloud environments and substrates.

Aside from a VM operator, Charmed Kafka K8s provides support for Kubernetes environments. For more information, please refer to the Charmed Kafka K8s documentation [here](/t/charmed-kafka-k8s-documentation/10296).
