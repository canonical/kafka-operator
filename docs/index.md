# Charmed Kafka documentation

Charmed Kafka is an open-source operator that makes it easier to manage Apache Kafka, with built-in support for enterprise features. 

Apache Kafka is a free, open source software project by the Apache Software Foundation. Users can find out more at the [Kafka project page](https://kafka.apache.org).

Charmed Kafka is built on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/) and reliably simplifies the deployment, scaling, design, and management of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) in production. Additionally, you can use the charm to manage your Kafka clusters with automation capabilities. It also offers replication, TLS, password rotation, easy-to-use application integration, and monitoring.
Charmed Kafka operates Apache Kafka on physical systems, Virtual Machines (VM), and a wide range of cloud and cloud-like environments, including AWS, Azure, OpenStack, and VMware. 

Charmed Kafka is a solution designed and developed to help ops teams and 
administrators automate Apache Kafka operations from [Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/), across multiple cloud environments and platforms.

[note]
Canonical has also developed the [Charmed Kafka K8s operator](/t/charmed-kafka-k8s-documentation/10296) to support Kafka in Kubernetes environments.

Charmed Kafka is developed and supported by [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), as part of its commitment to 
provide open-source, self-driving solutions, seamlessly integrated using the Operator Framework Juju. Please
