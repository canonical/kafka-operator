## Charmed Kafka Documentation

Charmed Kafka is an open-source operator that makes it easier to manage Apache Kafka, with built-in support for enterprise features. 

Charmed Kafka is built on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/) and reliably simplifies the deployment, scaling, design, and management of Apache Kafka in production. Additionally, you can use the charm to manage your Kafka clusters with automation capabilities. It also offers replication, TLS, password rotation, easy-to-use application integration, and monitoring.
Charmed Kafka operates Apache Kafka on physical systems, Virtual Machines (VM) and a wide range of cloud and cloud-like environments, including AWS, Azure, OpenStack and VMWare. 

Charmed Kafka is a solution designed and developed for helping ops teams and 
administrators to automate Apache Kafka operations from day 0 to day 2, across multiple cloud environments and platforms.

[note]
Canonical has also developed the [Charmed Kafka K8s operator]((/t/charmed-kafka-k8s-documentation/10296)) to support Kafka in Kubernetes environments.
[/note]

Charmed Kafka is developed and supported by [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), as part of its commitment to 
provide open-source, self-driving solutions, seamlessly integrated using the Operator Framework Juju. Please 
refer to [charmhub.io](https://charmhub.io/), for more charmed operators integrated in the Juju ecosystem.
