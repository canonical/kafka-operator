# Get a Charmed Kafka and Zookeeper up and running

This is part of the [Charmed Kafka Tutorial](/t/charmed-kafka-tutorial-overview/10571). Please refer to this page for more information and the overview of the content. 

## Deploy

To deploy Charmed Kafka, all you need to do is run the following command, which will fetch the needed charms([Kafka](https://charmhub.io/kafka?channel=3/stable) and [Zookeeper](https://charmhub.io/zookeeper?channel=3/stable)) from [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/) and deploy it to your model:

```shell
$ juju deploy zookeeper -n 5
$ juju deploy kafka -n 3
```

After this, it is necessary to connect them:

```shell
$ juju relate kafka zookeeper
```

Juju will now fetch Charmed Kafka and Zookeeper and begin deploying it to the LXD cloud. This process can take several minutes depending on how provisioned (RAM, CPU,etc) your machine is. You can track the progress by running:
```shell
juju status --watch 1s
```

This command is useful for checking the status of Charmed Zookeeper and Charmed Kafka and gathering information about the machines hosting the two applications. Some of the helpful information it displays include IP addresses, ports, state, etc. 
The command updates the status of the cluster every second and as the application starts you can watch the status and messages of Charmed Kafka and Zookeeper change. 

Wait until the application is ready - when it is ready, `juju status --watch 1s` will show:
```shell

To exit the screen with `juju status --watch 1s`, enter `Ctrl+c`.


## Access Kafka cluster

To watch the process, `juju status` can be used. Once all the units show as `active|idle` the credentials to access a broker can be queried with:
```shell
juju run-action kafka/leader get-admin-credentials --wait
```

The output of the previous command is something like this:
```shell
unit-kafka-1:
  UnitId: kafka/1
  id: "2"
  results:
    client-properties: |-
      sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required username="admin" password="e2sMfYLQg7sbbBMFTx1qlaZQKTUxr09x";
      bootstrap.servers=10.244.26.19:9092,10.244.26.6:9092,10.244.26.43:9092
      security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
      sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: e2sMfYLQg7sbbBMFTx1qlaZQKTUxr09x
    username: admin

    started: 2023-04-25 09:02:59 +0000 UTC
```

Apache Kafka ships with `bin/*.sh` commands to do various administrative tasks, e.g `bin/kafka-config.sh` to update cluster configuration, `bin/kafka-topics.sh` for topic management, and many more! The Kafka Charmed Operator provides these commands to administrators to easily run their desired cluster configurations securely with SASL authentication, either from within the cluster or as an external client.

If you wish to run a command from the cluster, in order to (for example) list the current topics on the Kafka cluster, you can run:
```
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=$(juju run-action kafka/leader get-admin-credentials --wait | grep "bootstrap.servers" | cut -d "=" -f 2)
juju ssh kafka/leader 'charmed-kafka.topics --bootstrap-server $BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS --list --command-config /var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/client.properties'
```

Note that when no other application is related to Kafka, the cluster is secured-by-default and listeners are disabled, thus preventing any incoming connection. However, even for running the commands above, listeners must be enable. If there is no other application, deploy a [data-integrator](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator) charm and relate it to Kafka, as outlined in the Relation section to enable listeners.

Available Kafka bin commands can be found with:
```shell
snap info charmed-kafka --channel 3/edge
```
