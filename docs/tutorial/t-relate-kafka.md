# Relate your Kafka deployment 

This is part of the [Charmed Kafka Tutorial](/t/charmed-kafka-tutorial-overview/10571). Please refer to this page for more information and the overview of the content. 

## Relations
Relations, or what Juju documentation [describes as Integration](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/integration), are the easiest way to create a user for Kafka in Charmed Kafka. Relations automatically create a username, password, and topic for the desired user/application. 

### Data Integrator Charm
To start using the Kafka cluster, we will now relate our application to the [Data Integrator Charm](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator). This is a bare-bones charm that allows for central management of database users, providing support for different kinds of data platforms (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, OpenSearch, etc) with a consistent, opinionated and robust user experience. In order to deploy the Data Integrator Charm we can use the command `juju deploy` we have learned above:

```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --channel stable --config topic-name=test-topic --config extra-user-roles=producer,consumer
```
The expected output:
```shell
Located charm "data-integrator" in charm-hub, revision 11
Deploying "data-integrator" from charm-hub charm "data-integrator", revision 11 in channel stable on jammy
```

### Relate to Kafka
Now that the Database Integrator Charm has been set up, we can relate it to Kafka. This will automatically create a username, password, and database for the Database Integrator Charm. Relate the two applications with:
```shell
juju relate data-integrator kafka
```
Wait for `juju status --watch 1s` to show:
```shell

To retrieve information such as the username, password, and topic. Enter:
```shell
juju run-action data-integrator/leader get-credentials --wait
```
This should output something like:
```yaml
â€‹unit-data-integrator-0:
  UnitId: data-integrator/0
  id: "4"
  results:
    kafka:
      consumer-group-prefix: relation-6-

```

Save the value listed under `bootstrap-server`, `username` and `password`. *(Note: your hostnames, usernames, and passwords will likely be different.)*

### Remove the user
To remove the user, remove the relation. Removing the relation automatically removes the user that was created when the relation was created. Enter the following to remove the relation:
```shell
juju remove-relation kafka data-integrator
```

The output of the juju model should be something like this:

```shell
