# Relate your Kafka deployment 

This is part of the [Charmed Kafka Tutorial](/t/charmed-kafka-tutorial-overview/10571). Please refer to this page for more information and the overview of the content. 

## Relations
Relations, or what Juju documentation [describes as Integration](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/integration), are the easiest way to create a user for Kafka in Charmed Kafka. Relations automatically create a username, password, and topic for the desired user/application. 

### Data Integrator Charm
To start using the Kafka cluster, we will now relate our application to the [Data Integrator Charm](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator). This is a bare-bones charm that allows for central management of database users, providing support for different kinds of data platforms (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, OpenSearch, etc) with a consistent, opinionated and robust user experience. In order to deploy the Data Integrator Charm we can use the command `juju deploy` we have learned above:

```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --channel stable --config topic-name=test-topic --config extra-user-roles=producer,consumer
```
The expected output:
```shell
Located charm "data-integrator" in charm-hub, revision 11
Deploying "data-integrator" from charm-hub charm "data-integrator", revision 11 in channel stable on jammy
```

### Relate to Kafka
Now that the Database Integrator Charm has been set up, we can relate it to Kafka. This will automatically create a username, password, and database for the Database Integrator Charm. Relate the two applications with:
```shell
juju relate data-integrator kafka
```
Wait for `juju status --watch 1s` to show:
```shell

To retrieve information such as the username, password, and topic. Enter:
```shell
juju run-action data-integrator/leader get-credentials --wait
```
This should output something like:
```yaml

  UnitId: data-integrator/0
  id: "4"
  results:

      consumer-group-prefix: relation-6-

```

Save the value listed under `bootstrap-server`, `username` and `password`. *(Note: your hostnames, usernames, and passwords will likely be different.)*

### Produce/Consume messages

We will now use the username and password to produce some messages to Kafka. To do so, we will first deploy a test charm that bundles some python scripts to push data to Kafka, e.g.

```shell
juju deploy kafka-test-app -n1 --channel edge
```

Once the charm is up and running, you can log into the container

```shell
juju ssh kafka-test-app/0 /bin/bash
```

and make sure that the Python virtual environment libraries are visible:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH="/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-kafka-test-app-0/charm/venv:/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-kafka-test-app-0/charm/lib"
```

Once this is setup, you should be able to use the `client.py` script that exposes some functionality to produce and consume messages. 
You can explore the usage of the script

```shell
python3 -m charms.kafka.v0.client --help

usage: client.py [-h] [-t TOPIC] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-c CONSUMER_GROUP_PREFIX] [-s SERVERS] [-x SECURITY_PROTOCOL] [-n NUM_MESSAGES] [-r REPLICATION_FACTOR] [--num-partitions NUM_PARTITIONS]
                 [--producer] [--consumer] [--cafile-path CAFILE_PATH] [--certfile-path CERTFILE_PATH] [--keyfile-path KEYFILE_PATH] [--mongo-uri MONGO_URI] [--origin ORIGIN]

Handler for running a Kafka client

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TOPIC, --topic TOPIC
                        Kafka topic provided by Kafka Charm
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Kafka username provided by Kafka Charm
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Kafka password provided by Kafka Charm
  -c CONSUMER_GROUP_PREFIX, --consumer-group-prefix CONSUMER_GROUP_PREFIX
                        Kafka consumer-group-prefix provided by Kafka Charm
  -s SERVERS, --servers SERVERS
                        comma delimited list of Kafka bootstrap-server strings
  -x SECURITY_PROTOCOL, --security-protocol SECURITY_PROTOCOL
                        security protocol used for authentication
  -n NUM_MESSAGES, --num-messages NUM_MESSAGES
                        number of messages to send from a producer
  -r REPLICATION_FACTOR, --replication-factor REPLICATION_FACTOR
                        replcation.factor for created topics
  --num-partitions NUM_PARTITIONS
                        partitions for created topics
  --producer
  --consumer
  --cafile-path CAFILE_PATH
  --certfile-path CERTFILE_PATH
  --keyfile-path KEYFILE_PATH
  --mongo-uri MONGO_URI
  --origin ORIGIN
```

Using this script, you can therefore start producing messages (change the values of `username`, `password` and `servers`)

```shell
python3 -m charms.kafka.v0.client \
  -u relation-6 -p S4IeRaYaiiq0tsM7m2UZuP2mSI573IGV \
  -t test-topic \
  -s "10.244.26.43:9092,10.244.26.6:9092,10.244.26.19:9092" \
  -n 10 --producer \
  -r 3 --num-partitions 1
```

and consume them 

```shell
python3 -m charms.kafka.v0.client \
  -u relation-6 -p S4IeRaYaiiq0tsM7m2UZuP2mSI573IGV \
  -t test-topic \
  -s "10.244.26.43:9092,10.244.26.6:9092,10.244.26.19:9092" \
  --consumer \
  -c "cg"
```

### Remove the user
To remove the user, remove the relation. Removing the relation automatically removes the user that was created when the relation was created. Enter the following to remove the relation:
```shell
juju remove-relation kafka data-integrator
```

The output of the juju model should be something like this:

```shell
