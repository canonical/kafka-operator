# File System Path

In the following table, we summarize some of the most relevant file paths used in the Kafka and ZooKeeper charms.

## Kafka 

| Path                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Permission                                    |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| /snap/charmed-kafka/current/opt/kafka          | Binary files for the Charmed Kafka distribution. Note that this is a readonly squashfs file system.                                                                                                   | (read-only)                                   | 
| /snap/charmed-kafka/current/opt/kafka/bin/*.sh | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with Kafka.                                                                                                        | (read-only)                                   |
| /var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/etc/kafka/     | Configuration files used by Kafka daemon process. These files are generally written and managed by the charm.                                                                                         | (owned by `snap_daemon`, managed by `charm`)  |
| /var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/var/log/kafka/  | Application Logging files generated by the Kafka daemon process. These files are written by the workload, but they may be read by other components to provide monitoring (e.g. grafana and/or charm). | (owned and managed by `snap_daemon`)          |
| /var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/var/lib/kafka/  | Raw data stored persistently by Kafka during its operations. The files are written and managed by Kafka only.                                                                                         | (owned and managed by `snap_daemon`)          |

External storage is used for storing persistent raw data that is mounted at `/var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/var/lib/kafka/<storage-id>`, with `<storage-id>` being a progressive number.

Multiple storage volumes can be used for providing both horizontal scalability and provide IO parallelization to enhance throughput. 

## Zookeeper 

| Path                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | Permission                                    |

| /snap/charmed-zookeeper/current/opt/zookeeper/bin/*.sh | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with ZooKeeper.                                                                                                        | (read-only)                                   |
| /var/snap/charmed-zookeeper/current/etc/zookeeper/     | Configuration files used by ZooKeeper daemon process. These files are generally written and managed by the charm.                                                                                         | (owned by `snap_daemon`, managed by `charm`)  |

| /var/snap/charmed-zookeeper/common/var/lib/zookeeper/  | Raw data stored persistently by ZooKeeper during its operations. The files are written and managed by ZooKeeper only.                                                                                     | (owned and managed by `snap_daemon`)          |
