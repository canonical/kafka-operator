# File system path

In the following table, we summarize some of the most relevant file paths used in the Apache Kafka and Apache ZooKeeper charms.

## Apache Kafka 

| Path                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Permission                                    |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/snap/charmed-kafka/current/opt/kafka`          | Binary files for the Charmed Apache Kafka distribution. Note that this is a read-only Squashfs file system.                                                                                                   | (read-only)                                   | 
| `/snap/charmed-kafka/current/opt/kafka/bin/*.sh` | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with Apache Kafka.                                                                                                        | (read-only)                                   |
| `/var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/etc/kafka/`     | Configuration files used by Apache Kafka daemon process. These files are generally written and managed by the charm.                                                                                         | (owned by `snap_daemon`, managed by `charm`)  |
| `/var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/var/log/kafka/`  | Application Logging files generated by the Apache Kafka daemon process. These files are written by the workload, but they may be read by other components to provide monitoring (for example, Grafana or other charms). | (owned and managed by `snap_daemon`)          |
| `/var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/var/lib/kafka/`  | Raw data stored persistently by Apache Kafka during its operations. The files are written and managed by Apache Kafka only.                                                                                         | (owned and managed by `snap_daemon`)          |

External storage is used for storing persistent raw data that is mounted at `/var/snap/charmed-kafka/common/var/lib/kafka/<storage-id>`, with `<storage-id>` being a progressive number.

Multiple storage volumes can be used for providing both horizontal scalability and provide IO parallelisation to enhance throughput. 

## Apache ZooKeeper 

| Path                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | Permission                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|

| `/snap/charmed-zookeeper/current/opt/zookeeper/bin/*.sh` | General bash scripts to provide helpers and utilities for managing and interacting with Apache ZooKeeper.                                                                                                        | (read-only)                                   |
