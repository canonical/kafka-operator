# Migrate from a non-charmed Apache Kafka

This How-To guide covers executing a cluster migration to a Charmed Apache Kafka deployment using MirrorMaker 2.0.

The MirrorMaker runs on the new (destination) cluster as a process on each Juju unit in an active/passive setup. It acts as a consumer from an existing cluster (source) and a producer to the Charmed Apache Kafka cluster (target). Data and consumer offsets for all existing topics will be synced **one-way** in parallel (one process on each unit) until both clusters are in-sync, with all data replicated across both in real-time.

```{note}
For a brief explanation of how MirrorMaker works, see the [MirrorMaker explanation](explanation-mirrormaker2-0) page.
```

## Pre-requisites

To migrate a cluster we need:

- An "old" existing Apache Kafka cluster to migrate from.
  - The cluster needs to be reachable from/to the new Apache Kafka cluster. 
- A bootstrapped Juju VM cloud running Charmed Apache Kafka to migrate to. For guidance on how to deploy a new Charmed Apache Kafka, see:
  - The [Charmed Apache Kafka Tutorial](tutorial-introduction)
  - The [How to deploy guide](how-to-deploy-deploy-anywhere) for Charmed Apache Kafka
- The CLI tool `yq` - [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
  - `snap install yq --channel=v3/stable`

## Getting cluster details and admin credentials

By design, the `kafka` charm will not expose any available connections until related by a client. In this case, we deploy `data-integrator` charms and relate them to each `kafka` application, requesting `admin` level privileges:

```bash
juju deploy data-integrator --channel=edge -n 1 --config extra-user-roles="admin" --config topic-name="default"
juju relate kafka data-integrator
```

When the `data-integrator` charm relates to a `kafka` application on the `kafka-client` relation interface, passing `extra-user-roles=admin`, a new user with `super.user` permissions will be created on that cluster, with the charm passing back the credentials and broker addresses in the relation data to the `data-integrator`.
As we will need full access to both clusters, we must grab these newly generated authorisation credentials from the `data-integrator`.

SASL credentials to connect to the target Charmed Apache Kafka cluster:

```bash
export NEW_USERNAME=$(juju show-unit data-integrator/0 | yq -r '.. | .username? // empty')
export NEW_PASSWORD=$(juju show-unit data-integrator/0 | yq -r '.. | .password? // empty')
```

List of bootstrap-server IPs:

```bash
export NEW_SERVERS=$(juju show-unit data-integrator/0 | yq -r '.. | .endpoints? // empty')
```

Building full `sasl.jaas.config` for authorisation:

```bash
export NEW_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG="org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required username=\""${NEW_USERNAME}"\" password=\""${NEW_PASSWORD}\"\;
```

## Required source cluster credentials

MirrorMaker needs full `super.user` permissions on **BOTH** clusters. It supports every possible `security.protocol` supported by Apache Kafka. In this guide, we will make the assumption that the source cluster is using `SASL_PLAINTEXT` authentication, as such, the required information is as follows:

- `OLD_SERVERS` -- comma-separated list of Apache Kafka server IPs and ports to connect to
- `OLD_SASL_USERNAME` -- string of `sasl.jaas.config` property

```{note}
For `SSL` or `SASL_SSL` authentication, see the configuration options supported by Kafka Connect in the [Apache Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs).
```

## Creating `mm2.properties` file on the Apache Kafka cluster

MirrorMaker takes a `.properties` file for its configuration to fine-tune behaviour. See below an example `mm2.properties` file that can be placed on each of the Apache Kafka units using the above credentials:

```properties
# Aliases for each cluster, can be set to any unique alias
clusters = old,new

# Specifies that data from 'old' should be consumed and produced to 'new', and NOT visa-versa, i.e 'active/passive' setup
old->new.enabled = true
new->old.enabled = false

# comma-separated list of Apache Kafka server IPs and ports to connect from both clusters
old.bootstrap.servers=$OLD_SERVERS
new.bootstrap.servers=$NEW_SERVERS

# sasl authentication config for each cluster, in this case using the 'admin' users created by the integrator charm for Charmed Apache Kafka
old.sasl.jaas.config=$OLD_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG
new.sasl.jaas.config=$NEW_SASL_JAAS_CONFIG

# if not deployed with TLS, Charmed Apache Kafka uses SCRAM-SHA-512 for SASL auth, with a SASL_PLAINTEXT listener
sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-512
security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT

# keeps topic names consistent across clusters - see https://kafka.apache.org/30/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/mirror/IdentityReplicationPolicy.html
replication.policy.class=org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy

# pattern match for replicating all topics and all consumer groups
topics=.*
groups=.*

# the expected number of concurrent MirrorMaker tasks, usually set to match number of physical cores on the target cluster
tasks.max=3

# the new replication.factor for topics produced to the target cluster
replication.factor=2

# allows new topics and groups created mid-migration, to be copied
refresh.topics.enabled=true
sync.group.offsets.enabled=true
sync.topic.configs.enabled=true
refresh.topics.interval.seconds=5
refresh.groups.interval.seconds=5
sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds=5
emit.checkpoints.interval.seconds=5

# filters out records from aborted transactions
old.consumer.isolation.level=read_committed
new.consumer.isolation.level=read_committed

# Specific Connector configuration for ensuring Exactly-Once-Delivery (EOD)
# NOTE - EOD support guarantees released with Apache Kafka 3.5.0 so some of these options may not work as expected
old.producer.enable.idempotence=true
new.producer.enable.idempotence=true
old.producer.acks=all
new.producer.acks=all
# old.exactly.once.support = enabled
# new.exactly.once.support = enabled
```

Once these properties file has been prepared, place it on every Apache Kafka unit:

```bash
cat mm2.properties | juju ssh kafka/<id> sudo -i 'sudo tee -a /var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/etc/kafka/mm2.properties'
```

## Starting a dedicated MirrorMaker cluster

We strongly recommend running MirrorMaker services on the downstream (target) cluster to avoid service impact due to resource use. Now that the properties are set on each unit of the new cluster, the MirrorMaker services can be started with JMX metrics exporters.

Prepare the `KAFKA_OPTS` environment variable for running with an exporter:

```bash
export KAFKA_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/etc/kafka/zookeeper-jaas.cfg -javaagent:/var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/opt/kafka/libs/jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar=9099:/var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/etc/kafka/jmx_kafka_connect.yaml"
```

Start MirrorMaker on each target Charmed Apache Kafka unit:

```bash
juju ssh kafka/<id> sudo -i 'cd /snap/charmed-kafka/current/opt/kafka/bin && KAFKA_OPTS=$KAFKA_OPTS ./connect-mirror-maker.sh /var/snap/charmed-kafka/current/etc/kafka/mm2.properties'
```

## Monitoring and validating data replication

The migration process can be monitored using the original cluster's built-in Apache Kafka bin commands. In the Charmed Apache Kafka cluster, these bin commands are also mapped to snap commands on the units (e.g. `charmed-kafka.get-offsets` or `charmed-kafka.topics`).

To monitor the current consumer offsets, run the following on the original/source cluster being migrated from:

```bash
watch "bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe --offsets --bootstrap-server $OLD_SERVERS --all-groups"
```

An example output of which may look similar to this:

```text
GROUP           TOPIC               PARTITION  CURRENT-OFFSET  LOG-END-OFFSET  LAG             CONSUMER-ID                                             HOST            CLIENT-ID
admin-group-1   NEW-TOPIC           0          95              95              0               kafka-python-2.0.2-a95b3f90-75e9-4a16-b63e-5e021b7344c5 /10.248.204.1   kafka-python-2.0.2
admin-group-1   NEW-TOPIC           3          98              98              0               kafka-python-2.0.2-a95b3f90-75e9-4a16-b63e-5e021b7344c5 /10.248.204.1   kafka-python-2.0.2
admin-group-1   NEW-TOPIC           1          82              82              0               kafka-python-2.0.2-a95b3f90-75e9-4a16-b63e-5e021b7344c5 /10.248.204.1   kafka-python-2.0.2
admin-group-1   NEW-TOPIC           2          89              90              1               kafka-python-2.0.2-a95b3f90-75e9-4a16-b63e-5e021b7344c5 /10.248.204.1   kafka-python-2.0.2
admin-group-1   NEW-TOPIC           4          103             104             1               kafka-python-2.0.2-a95b3f90-75e9-4a16-b63e-5e021b7344c5 /10.248.204.1   kafka-python-2.0.2
```

There is also a [range of different metrics](https://kafka.apache.org/39/documentation.html#georeplication-monitoring) made available by MirrorMaker during the migration. To check the metrics, send a request to the `/metrics` endpoint:

```shell
curl 10.248.204.198:9099/metrics | grep records_count
```

## Switching client traffic

Once happy with data migration, stop all active consumer applications on the original/source cluster and redirect them to the new/target Charmed Apache Kafka cluster, making sure to use the Charmed Apache Kafka cluster server addresses and authentication. After doing so, they will re-join their original consumer groups at the last committed offset it had originally, and continue consuming as normal.

Finally, the producer client applications can be stopped, updated with the Charmed Apache Kafka cluster server addresses and authentication, and restarted, with any newly produced messages being received by the migrated consumer client applications, completing the migration of both the data, and the client applications.

## Stopping MirrorMaker replication

Once confident in the successful completion of the data client migration, stop the running MirrorMaker processes on each unit of the Charmed Apache Kafka cluster.
